# Simple example to demonstrate dead features

feature 1 Base
feature 2 FeatureA
feature 3 FeatureB
feature 4 DeadFeature

# Base is mandatory
mandatory 1

# FeatureA and FeatureB are mutually exclusive
excludes 2 3

# DeadFeature requires both A and B (impossible!)
requires 4 2
requires 4 3

# Result: DeadFeature can never be selected (it's dead)
